# ESP-RGBWW
ESP32C3-RGBWW: 5CH LED controller.


Features:
* ESPHome compatible,
* BTproxy,
* 5x low side mosfet (suitable for led strips),
* 4x GPIO on pinhead (addressable leds output, switch input, motion sensor input, sensors and so more),
* 3.3V, 5V, GND on pinhead for sensors powering,
* dual power input (high and low power) - module can be powered by small power supply (while leds are off) and can enable high power supply for powering led, 
* USBC for flashing,
* suitable for 12-24V led strip (or 5V addressable with external power supply),
* 16A screw terminal block connectors for high power input/output,
* LED: status (green).
